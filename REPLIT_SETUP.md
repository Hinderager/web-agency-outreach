# ðŸ¤– Replit Integration Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up Replit integration for automated website generation in our web agency outreach workflow.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Our enhanced workflow now includes:
1. **Standard Analysis** (existing) - Website scraping and branding extraction
2. **Replit AI Generation** (new) - Custom website creation using prompts
3. **Vercel Deployment** (enhanced) - Deploy generated websites
4. **Google Sheets Updates** (existing) - Track results

## ðŸ”§ Setup Steps

### 1. Get Replit API Token

Based on the [Replit API documentation](https://docs.replit.com/extensions/category/api-reference):

1. Go to [Replit.com](https://replit.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Navigate to Account Settings
4. Generate an API token
5. Copy the token

### 2. Add Token to Environment

Add your Replit token to the `.env` file:

```bash
REPLIT_TOKEN=your_actual_replit_token_here
```

### 3. Test Integration

Run the enhanced workflow:

```bash
# Generate leads data first
node scripts/score_and_assets_simple.js

# Run with Replit integration
node scripts/branches_and_previews_with_replit.js
```

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### Prompt Generation
The system automatically generates comprehensive prompts for each prospect:

```javascript
const prompt = `Create a professional, modern website for ${businessName}, 
a ${industry} business located in ${city}.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Primary color: ${primaryColor}
- Secondary color: ${secondaryColor}
- Mobile-responsive design
- Professional typography

SECTIONS:
- Hero with compelling headline
- Services/About section
- Contact information
- Call-to-action buttons
```

### Website Generation Process

1. **Create Replit Project** - New project for each prospect
2. **AI Generation** - Use Replit's Exec API with our prompt
3. **Download Files** - Use Filesystem API to get generated HTML/CSS/JS
4. **Enhance with Data** - Inject business-specific information
5. **Deploy to Vercel** - Copy to preview-app and push to Git

### Fallback System

If Replit generation fails:
- âœ… Continues with existing preview system
- âœ… Logs the error for debugging
- âœ… Still creates Vercel deployment
- âœ… Updates Google Sheets normally

## ðŸš€ Expected Results

### Enhanced Previews
- **AI-Generated Websites**: Full custom websites for each prospect
- **Brand Integration**: Automatic color and content customization
- **Professional Design**: Modern, conversion-focused layouts
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on all devices

### Workflow Integration
- **Seamless Fallback**: Works even if Replit is unavailable
- **Progress Tracking**: Logs all steps and results
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation to existing system
- **Performance**: Parallel processing where possible

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Success Indicators
- âœ… Replit project creation successful
- âœ… Website generation completed
- âœ… Files downloaded and enhanced
- âœ… Vercel deployment working
- âœ… Preview shows generated website

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **API Token Invalid**
   - Check token in `.env` file
   - Verify token permissions in Replit dashboard

2. **Generation Timeout**
   - Increase timeout in script
   - Check Replit service status

3. **File Download Errors**
   - Verify Filesystem API permissions
   - Check network connectivity

4. **Deployment Issues**
